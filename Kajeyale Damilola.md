I was assigned to work on the style guide with a teammate and specifically issued the spacers to work on. Here is a link to my issued task; https://github.com/zuri-training/Chunk-File_Proj_team_49/issues/60#issue-1324649702 and a link to my finished work; https://www.figma.com/file/avaD8B1hOxxmzSQ1Qx5A0m/Chunk-file-proj_team_49?node-id=1506%3A4444
I was assigned together with a teammate to work on the "how to use page" and i was able to work on the wireframe, low fidelity and high fidelity of the page. Here is the link to the task being issued to me by my team lead; https://github.com/zuri-training/Chunk-File_Proj_team_49/issues/61#issue-1324651311 and a link to my finished work; (for high fidelity) https://www.figma.com/file/avaD8B1hOxxmzSQ1Qx5A0m/Chunk-file-proj_team_49?node-id=1343%3A6559 ,(for low fidelity) https://www.figma.com/file/avaD8B1hOxxmzSQ1Qx5A0m/Chunk-file-proj_team_49?node-id=1323%3A4280 , (for wireframe) https://www.figma.com/file/avaD8B1hOxxmzSQ1Qx5A0m/Chunk-file-proj_team_49?node-id=1506%3A3781
Also, we were allowed to go through and edit each other's work although it had to be with permission. So asides the individual task issued, we brainstormed ideas and edited the whole project together.
I have been assigned to be one of the presenters for the final presentation too.
