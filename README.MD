# Chunk49
​
Chunk49 is a platform that accepts large json and csv files and splits them into smaller bits.
​ Our team, though, there are various chunking platforms, provides users with high quality output files with less the size of the original file in a zipped format. Our well-designed platform also affords users irrespective of technological knowledge an easy to navigate structure with an aesthetically appealing view.
